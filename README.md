This example demonstrates a common COBOL error involving the improper handling of spaces as null values. The code attempts to check if a customer name is missing; however, it uses SPACES to check for empty strings, which can easily lead to errors if the variable is not initialized correctly.  The solution provides a more robust method for detecting missing data using a dedicated flag or indicator variable.
